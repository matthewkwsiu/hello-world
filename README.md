# hello-world
This is a test run of github

testing out branches
-branches are kinda like experimental development of the main software, but without actually disrupting the main software, just in case you make a mistake
-benifits of branches,
  -It allows you to have multiple people working on the main software at the same time
  -it allows for a fallback version in case you mess up
